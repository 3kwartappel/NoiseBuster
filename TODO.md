# Project Tasks

This file tracks the upcoming tasks for the NoiseBuster project.
Always test if changes work correctly after completion.
Update documentation if its working correctly. 

## Task List

- 1. [ ] fix unit tests
  2. [ ] fix security flaws raised by github on github (ensure tests still succeed)
  3. [ ] currently we need an actual camera and decibel meter to know if things are really working. how can this be tested in github actions without those? should we have a preset video that it can run logic on in realtime?

*Note: This list can be used as a basis for creating GitHub Issues.*
